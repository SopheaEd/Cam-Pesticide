## Accessing the validity and reliability of measures
__Measures Validity__
```
Face validity
Content validity
Criterion validity
Predictive validity
Construct validity

```
__Test reliability__
```
Test-retest
Multiple-forms test
Split-half test
Noise and bias
```

__First takes__
- Validity tests
  - face
  - content
  - criterian
    - predictive
    - concurrent
- Reliabilit tests
  - test-retest
  - multiple forms
  - split-half techniques
- Measurement error - it is inevitabl; idea is to control it.
  - Noise (many, resource)
  - Bias (many  resource)
