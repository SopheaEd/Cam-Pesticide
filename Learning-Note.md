# Chapter 4 Designing Ideas
## The research plan
Step for research process:
1. Idea phase
   - Review the literature
   - State/share your theory
   - Ask your questions or state your problem or hypothesis
2. Design phase
   - Give your research question/issue, develop an overall design or blue print for:
     - collecting the data
     - selecting units of analysis
     - sampling
     - measurement
     - planned analysis
3. Data collection phase
    - pretesting
    - pilot studies
    - final data collection
4. Analysis phase
   - select the right statistics/techniques for answering the research question
5. Writting/communication phase
   - share the details as well as the results of your executed study in a well-crafted written report/article
### Comming up with the right question
- Not all questions are **worthy**
- Questions should be **researchable**
- Questions must be **interesting**
  - resolves a conflict
  - extends an established question to a new population or subpopulation or to a new time period

  - measures a new measures for addressing an old question
  - addresses a gap
  - keep a supprise element
  - finds a new answer to an old question
- Questions must be **answerable** through _scientific methods_ and _empirical data_
### Reviewing the literature
- literature gives students a chance to see how others have **approach** or **tackled similar questions or issues**
- helps with **theoretical framing** of an issue
- formulates good research questions
- allows students to plan & executing a successful piece of research
- helps clarify & refine research questions & issues
Steps:
- start the literature review as early as possible
- lauch a review earlier than later is a smart way to proceed
  - think & rethink
  - focus of research
- start the literature revew early help to save time
