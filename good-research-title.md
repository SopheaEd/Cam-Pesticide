## How to create a good research title
According to [[Mack, 2012]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chris-Mack-2/publication/278081968_How_to_write_a_good_scientific_paper_title_abstract_and_keywords/links/567c0f3008aebccc4e00dd21/How-to-write-a-good-scientific-paper-title-abstract-and-keywords.pdf#page=3.16), a good title should be contained as following basic guidlines:
- Clear aim of work
- Specific, but still describe the work
- Short (4-21 words)

A suggestion from Dr. Ly Kimlong, a good title of the thesis should be:
- No conjunction 'or' and 'and'
- Contained concepts
- Short and describe the work
