## Introduction
- The wall of water that can accompany an earthquake is conveyed in the concept "__tsunami__".
- The rise of sea levels and world temperature are now conveyed via the concept '__climate change__".
- **Concepts** are essential communication tools for communicating.
  - give & receive info effectively
 

## Concepts & the research process
- __Construct__ refers to concepts without empirical counterparts. It is a concept or mental abstraction that is not directly observable.
- __Theory__ is a set of propositions or statements about how the world or some entity operates or works.

## Bring theory down to earth
- __Translation process__ makes the concepts understandable to the empiricist.
- In performing this translation process, the researcher enguages in the measurement process. It converts concepts to variables.
- __Variables__ is empirical representation/indicators of abstract concepts; any trait or characteristic that vary.
- The researcher need to concern about **valid measures** or with achieving measurement validity.
- **Valid measures** refer to measures that actually measure what they claim to measure; measures that docs what hey claim to docs.

## Conceptualization
- The researchers try to achieve conceptual clarity by offering **theoretical (aka norminal) definitions** of concepts.
- **Theoretical (aka nominal or conceptual) definitions** refers to definitions that clarify the exact meaning of concepts being measured by offering synonyms for the concepts; aka dictionary definition.

> Sharpening your research vision: from **concepts** to **conceptual definition** to **variables**
> - Concept: _self-esteem_
>   - conceptual definition: an overall evaluation of one's worth or value
>   - variable: Rosenberg's self-esteem scale
>  - Concept: _shyness_
>    - concept definition: the tendency to feel awkard or tense in social situations
>    - variable: check and buss shyness scale

## Operationalization
- Once a researcher has achieved clarity, she/he can then get on the task of **finding the best empirical counterpart for the concept**.
- **Operationalization process** refer to process of finding __reasonable__ and __accurate__ impirical indicators for concepts.
